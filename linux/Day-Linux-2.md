1. Top Features of Linux

Open Source – Free to use, modify, and distribute.
High Stability – Rarely crashes, ideal for servers.
Security – Strong user permissions, SELinux, iptables firewall.
Multiuser Support – Multiple users can work simultaneously.
Multitasking – Run multiple processes without lag.
Portability – Runs on phones, laptops, servers, supercomputers.
Customization – You can modify kernel, shell, GUI, services.
Large Community Support – Millions of contributors.

2. Linux Everywhere

Linux powers:
Web servers (Facebook, Google, Amazon backend runs on Linux)
Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP mostly Linux-based)
Mobile devices (Android = modified Linux kernel)
IoT & embedded devices (routers, smart TVs, drones)
Supercomputers (100% of top 500 use Linux)
Cybersecurity tools (Kali, Parrot OS)
Developer machines (Ubuntu, Fedora, Pop!_OS)

3. Unlocking Linux Careers
